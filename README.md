# PhyloSuite

Phylogenetic analysis, manipulation and visualization of phylogenetic trees is a crucial step in any evolutionary study. While a plethora of different tools for these processes currently exist, they often lack integration into easy-to-use workflows. 

Here we present a suite of three complementary tools, RAxML-NG-and-Friends, ETElib and OliveTRee, which have been designed to streamline the analysis, manipulation and advanced visualization of phylogenetic data by combining the functionality of the most popular open-source phylogenetic tools and frameworks.
